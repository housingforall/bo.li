# Bo Li

I am a Senior Researcher at the Department of Sociology, John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies, Free University of Berlin, working with Prof. Sebastian Kohl. My research focuses on housing policy, rental markets, and comparative housing analysis across metropolitan areas.

## Research Interests

My research explores several interconnected areas in urban studies and housing:

- **Private Rental Sector Development** in metropolitan areas, with a focus on China's superstar cities
- **Housing Financialization** and its socio-spatial impacts
- **Comparative Housing Policy** across different institutional contexts
- **Urban Sociology** and housing inequalities
- **Rental Housing Market Dynamics** and landlord-tenant relationships

## Current Projects

I am currently leading two major research projects:

- **Financialization of Rental Housing: A Historical Comparative Global Study** (Rubicon Fellowship, Dutch Research Council, 2024-Present)
- Upcoming: **Foreign Real Estate Investment, Housing Affordability, and Regulations: A Comparative Political Economy Analysis of 50 Countries** (Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship, EU Commission, 2026-2028)
