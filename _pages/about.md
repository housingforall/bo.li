# Bo Li

I'm an Urban Geographer exploring the dynamics of rental housing markets and housing financialization.

My research bridges multiple scales: from the micro-level, where I examine tenants' well-being and residential choices, to the macro-level, where I analyze how institutional investment in rental markets shapes urban inequality.

Currently, I lead the FINRENT project as an NWO Rubicon Fellow, studying rental housing financialization across advanced and emerging economies—investigating its historical development, institutional strategies, and impacts on housing affordability and tenant well-being.

I'm also fortunate to have received a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship from the EU Commission for my project "Foreign Real Estate Investment, Housing Affordability, and Regulations: A Comparative Political Economy Analysis of 50 Countries."

Through a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches, including longitudinal big data and GIS analysis, I hope my research can contribute to evidence-based policy recommendations for regulating institutional investment in rental housing markets.

## Research Interests

My research explores several interconnected areas in urban studies and housing:

- **Private Rental Sector Development** in metropolitan areas, with a focus on China's superstar cities
- **Housing Financialization** and its socio-spatial impacts
- **Comparative Housing Policy** across different institutional contexts
- **Urban Sociology** and housing inequalities
- **Rental Housing Market Dynamics** and landlord-tenant relationships
-
