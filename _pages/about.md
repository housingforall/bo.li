Welcome to my academic homepage!

I am a Marie-Curie Fellow and Rubicon Fellow in the [John-F.-Kennedy Institute](https://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) at Free University Berlin, having received my Ph.D. in Urban Studies from Delft University of Technology.

My research interests span the rental housing sector, housing financialization, urban sociology, and migration studies. I investigate these topics across multiple scalesâ€”from examining tenants' well-being and residential choices to analyzing how institutional investment in rental markets shapes urban inequality.

I currently serve as Associate Editor for the *Journal of Urban Management* and *Humanities & Social Sciences Communications*.
